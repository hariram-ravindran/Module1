# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a='T'
b='a'
print(a)
print(b)
```
## Output
![440188482-e45b2c4e-c723-4262-9c78-d226d7ab0cf7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5852b3e6-7ac7-4ad9-b25a-3997917f0edc)

## Result

Thus the program which prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is done successfully.
