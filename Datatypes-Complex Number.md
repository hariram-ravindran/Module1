# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
## Output
![440188576-f85f736c-1cef-4be0-8d65-155b07f6d727](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bdb0d11-951c-43c8-82fc-f66c30bdabf2)

## Result
Thus the program which reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts is executed successfully.
